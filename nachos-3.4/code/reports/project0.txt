a) I used wget to retrieve the Nachos tar. After that, I compiled Nachos without issue using the nachos.cs.fiu.edu machine. 
It was accessed from a Windows 10 machine using PuTTy   

b) The tests ran fine without issue. The first test simply ran Halt() which
performs a syscall to halt the system before cleaning up. The second test
executed the same program but in single-step mode, showing the values of each
register at each tick. 

c) Threads in Nachos are implemented as a data structure that contains several pieces of information on the current state of a process
in execution. For instance, it contains storage for the program counter, execution stack, and so on. It also enumerates the current state of
the process such as RUNNING, READY, etc.
